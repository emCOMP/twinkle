Social Media Analysis Toolkit

The purpose of this toolkit is to accelerate some common social media analyses that are often performed. This is largely a library focused on aiding the development of simple tools along this path. Another project is also in development for some of these commonly used tools, such as migrating data between formats, performing basic analyses, creating graphs, and other visualiations. Currently, it is focused on Twitter Research. 

It is being developed by primarily by the [Emerging Capacities of Mass Participation Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/emcomp/) and the [SoMe Lab](http://somelab.net/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.uw.edu/).
